# Playdate SDK Test

This is a test of the Playdate SDK. Nothing special, just some attempts to write some basic game logic and display graphics.

It's based on the excellent [template for Playdate development in VS Code](https://github.com/cadin/playdate-vscode-template).

## Get Started

1. Clone this repo.
1. Ensure you have installed the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Open the repo root in VSCode as project.
1. Press Ctrl + F5 to run the build and open it in the simulator.
